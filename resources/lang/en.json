The project is born of a goal to make official data on Bangladesh more accessible and easy-to-digestâ€”to make their insights seamlessly integrate into important policy conversations.",

    "education description 1" : "all citizens must undertake ten years of compulsory education which consists of five years at primary school level and five years at high school level. Primary and secondary education is financed by the state and free of charge in public schools.",
    "education title 2" : "The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI)",
    "education description 2" : "finds that Bangladesh is fulfilling only 82.5% of what it should be fulfilling for the right to education based on the country's level of income.[8] HRMI breaks down the right to education by looking at the rights to both primary education and secondary education. While taking into consideration Bangladesh's income level, the nation is achieving 88.7% of what should be possible based on its resources (income) for primary education but only 76.3% for secondary education. Again the budgetary allocation is too meagre that the following source reiterates,Out of the total budget of Tk 678,064 crore for FY23, the allocation for the education sector is Tk 81,449 crore or 12 percent of the total, compared to 11.9 percent in FY22. In terms of GDP ratio, it is 1.83 percent, lower than the outgoing fiscal year's allocation. This is one of the lowest in the world far below the recommended minimum of 4-6 percent of GDP and 20 percent of the national budget."
